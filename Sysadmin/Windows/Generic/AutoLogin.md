Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard to launch the “Run” dialog box.

Type in:

```
control userpasswords2
```

Press Enter. The User Accounts window will display.

Uncheck the option “Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer”
```
Click “OK”
```

You will then be prompted to enter the current password and confirm it.
After doing so, you will no longer be prompted to enter your password upon login.
