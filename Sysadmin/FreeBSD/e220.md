# Installing Huawei E220 under FreeBSD 7.0

Initially I thought it would be rather tough but then after some tinkering I found an easy to use solution.

Quick Solution:

```
cd /sys/dev/usb
fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~erwin/e220-usb.diff
```

Tune your Kernel Config file and REMOVE ALL USB support options BUT the following:

```
# USB support
device      uhci        # UHCI PCI->USB interface
device      ehci        # EHCI PCI->USB interface (USB 2.0)
device      usb     # USB Bus (required)
```
```
cat << EOF >> /etc/ppp/ppp.conf

hsdpa:
 set device /dev/cuaU0
 set speed 57600
 set phone *99\#
 set authname
 set authkey
 set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
 set vj slotcomp off
 add default HISADDR
EOF
```
```
echo ubsa_load=\"YES\" >> /boot/loader.conf
```

Recompile Kernel and reboot
After reboot you can open an internet connection with

```
ppp -ddial hsdpa
```

Long story:

We need to patch the USB support for the "ubsa.ko" module to consider our E220 device.

```
cd /sys/dev/usb
fetch http://people.freebsd.org/~erwin/e220-usb.diff
```

Tune your Kernel Config file and REMOVE ALL usb support options BUT the following:
```
# USB support
device      uhci        # UHCI PCI->USB interface
device      ehci        # EHCI PCI->USB interface (USB 2.0)
device      usb     # USB Bus (required)
```

It is important that we load the USB as a module, strip the umass support as it won't work otherwise.
If you want to use the internal memory on the e220, my advice, buy another 8Gb USB stick for a few bucks.
We want mobile ADSL nothing else.


Add an entry to your ppp.conf so we can dial-up:

```
cat << EOF >> /etc/ppp/ppp.conf

hsdpa:
 set device /dev/cuaU0
 set speed 57600
 set phone *99\#
 set authname
 set authkey
 set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
 set vj slotcomp off
 add default HISADDR
EOF
```

Add the ubsa module to loader.conf so it gets loaded
```
echo ubsa_load=\"YES\" >> /boot/loader.conf
```

Recompile your Kernel, as a hint you can add
```
KERNCONF=KERNELNAME
```
to /etc/make.conf

Where KERNELNAME is the actual name of your kernel config file that resides in /sys/i386/conf/ (for i386 kernels)

now you can simply type
```
cd /usr/src
make kernel
```

and it will compile your kernel with the correct config file.
"make kernel" will effectively do a, "make buildkernel installkernel" so all you need to do is reboot and open a connection with
```
ppp -ddial hsdpa
```
