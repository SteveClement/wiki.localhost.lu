Upon boot I saw that sometimes, it provides in the case of: gdm.sh from the
fact that we grok in our custom profile and /bin/sh cant:

```

So we have to:

test -f /biggie/home/steve/.bashrc

once that works more trouble will arise as bash's if's are not ompatible with
sh test's best thing for gdm to do is: drop the suck'in of user profiles if
NOT running as root
