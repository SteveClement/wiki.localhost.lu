## gdb

First you will need gdb

```
brew install gdb
```

Now you want to codesign gdb

### Unhealthy

I made gdb work on OSX 10.9 without codesigning this way (described here):

Install gdb with macports. (may be you can skip it)
sudo nano /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.taskgated.plist
change option string from -s to -sp at line 22, col 27.
reboot the computer.
Use gdb


```
On MacOSX lldb needs to be code signed. The Debug and Release builds 
are set to code sign using a code signing certificate named 
lldb_codesign. 

If you don't have one yet you will need to:
- Launch /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app

- In Keychain Access select the "login" keychain in the "Keychains"
  list in the upper left hand corner of the window.

- Select the following menu item:

    Keychain Access->Certificate Assistant->Create a Certificate...

- Set the following settings

    Name = lldb_codesign
    Identity Type = Self Signed Root
    Certificate Type = Code Signing

- Click Continue
- Click Continue
- Click Done
- Click on the "My Certificates"
- Double click on your new lldb_codesign certificate
- Turn down the "Trust" disclosure triangle

    Change:
        When using this certificate: Always Trust

- Enter your login password to confirm and make it trusted

The next steps are necessary on SnowLeopard, but are probably because of a bug
how Keychain Access makes certificates.

- Option-drag the new lldb_codesign certificate from the login keychain to
  the System keychain in the Keychains pane of the main Keychain Access window
  to make a copy of this certificate in the System keychain.  You'll have to
  authorize a few more times, set it to be "Always trusted" when asked.
- Switch to the System keychain, and drag the copy of lldb_codesign you just
  made there onto the desktop.
- Switch to Terminal, and run the following:

sudo security add-trust -d -r trustRoot -p basic -p codeSign -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/Desktop/lldb_codesign.cer

- Right click on the "lldb_codesign" certificate in the "System" keychain (NOT
  "login", but the one in "System"), and select "Delete" to delete it from
  the "System" keychain.
- Reboot
- Clean and rebuild lldb and you should be able to debug.

That should do it.
