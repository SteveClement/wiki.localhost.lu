# Calibrating a Satellite Dish

It isn't really that hard :) was my first thought but the I got faced with a
pretty specific technical domain with lots of stuff to take care about if you
want a good signal and so on.

But if you want to keep it nice and gruntly just get an analog sat receiver and
2 people. The analog receiver was in the end the saving part. With an digital
receiver setting up has to be pretty accurate which isn't the case with the
analog setup. It's kinda wysiwyg which helps a lot, so you must already point
it into a generally correct direction and then tune it in the x axis first
after that y.
